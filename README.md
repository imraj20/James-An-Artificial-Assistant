# James-An-Artificial-Assistant
An AI assistant is a piece of software that understands verbal commands and completes task assigned by the client.

For most of us, the ultimate luxury would be an assistant who always listens for your call, anticipates your every need, and takes action when necessary. That luxury is now available thanks to artificial assistant James.

Feasibility Analysis:-
James works on certain trigger words. Using those triggered words it shows relevant results of given commands. The efficiency of this program will increase if we add more and more trigger words to the code.

SKILLS:-

1. Fetching data from Wikipedia:
The following commands helps to extract information from wikipedia. The wikipedia.summary() function takes two arguments, the statement given by the user and how many sentences from wikipedia is needed to be extracted is stored in a variable result.

2. Accessing the Web Browsers â€” Google chrome , G-Mail and YouTube: The web browser extracts data from web. The open_new_tab function accepts URL as a parameter that needs to be accessed. The Python time sleep function is used to add delay in the execution of a program. We can use this function to halt the execution of the program for given time in seconds.

3. To fetch latest news: If the user wants to know the latest news , The voice assistant is programmed to fetch top headline news from Time of India by using the web browser function

4. Predicting time: The current time is abstracted from datetime.now() function which displays the hour, minute and second and is stored in a variable name strTime.

5. Searching data from web: From the web browser you can search required data by passing the user statement (command) to the open_new_tab() function.

6. Extra features:
It would be interesting to program your AI assistant to answer the following questions like what it can and who created it . To log off your PC, the subprocess.call() function here is used to process the system function to log off or to turn off your PC. This invokes James to automatically turn off your PC.
